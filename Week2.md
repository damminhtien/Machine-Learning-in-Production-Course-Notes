# Select and Train a Model
## 1. Selecting and Training a Model
### 1.1 Key challenges
+ Model development is an iterative process
+ Model + Hyper params + data -> Tranining -> Error analysis
+ Challenges in model development
   + Doing well on traing set (usually measured by average training error)
   + Doing well on dev/test sets
   + Doing well on business metrics/project goals 
### 1.2 Why low average error isn't good enough
+ Performance on disproportionately important examples
+ Performance on key slices of the dataset
+ Rare classes
### 1.3 Establish a baseline
+ Establishing a baseline level of performance
+ Unstructured and structured data
